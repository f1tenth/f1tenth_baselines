# F1TENTH Benchmarks and Baseline Solutions

## Benchmark I: Static Kinodynamic Planning
The first benchmark involves a known track and a single vehicle. The objective is to navigate the track in a minimal amount of time. The task is considered successful only if the trajectory is collision-free.

## Benchmark II: Online Kinodynamic Planning
The second benchmark involves a known map with obstacles. The location of obstacles in the map is not known prior to runtime. The agent must detect and avoid static obstacles in real time.

## Benchmark III: Multi-agent Dynamic Games
The third benchmark involves a known map with two or more agents simultaneously driving on the map. The objective of each agent is to finish a number of laps faster than all other agents without collision.
